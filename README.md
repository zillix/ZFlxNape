# ZFlxNape
An implementation of the Nape physics engine integrated with Flixel

Developed originally for my 48-hour LD29 game "denudation"

Expanded upon for my 48-hour LD32 game "respire"

I have since cleaned it up a bit and reorganized it.
This is intended for my personal use, but anyone is free to use it.
I offer no warranty, or any guarantee that any of it works.

Since it was mainly archeteched in game jams, the structure isn't amazing.
However, it should be readable and functional.
